Why Data Structures and Algorithms Are Essential:
-Efficient handling of large inventories requires:
-Quick retrieval of product information.
-Fast updates when products are sold, added, or restocked.
-Organized storage to avoid duplication and ensure integrity.

Without appropriate data structures:
-Operations become slower as the inventory grows.
-Searching and updating records may require full scans, resulting in poor performance.

Suitable Data Structures:
-ArrayList: Simple, ordered list. Easy to implement but slower for searching (O(n)).
-HashMap: Key-value mapping. Fast lookup, insert, update, delete (average O(1)) using product ID as the key.
-TreeMap: Sorted map. Slower than HashMap (O(log n)) but maintains order if needed.
