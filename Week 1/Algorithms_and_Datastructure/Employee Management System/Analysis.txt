| Operation | Time Complexity | Description                               |
| --------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Add       | O(1)            | Appending to end of array                 |
| Traverse  | O(n)            | Visit all elements                        |
| Search    | O(n)            | Linear scan by ID                         |
| Delete    | O(n)            | Find + shift elements after deleted index |

Limitations of Arrays:
-Fixed size: can't grow beyond declared size.
-Insert/Delete operations can be expensive (O(n)).
-Less flexible than dynamic data structures like ArrayList or HashMap.

When to Use Arrays:
-When the number of employees is small and known in advance.
-When memory use and access speed matter.
-When simplicity is more important than flexibility.
