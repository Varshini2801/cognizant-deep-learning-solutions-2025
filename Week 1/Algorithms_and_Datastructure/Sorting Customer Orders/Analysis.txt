| Algorithm       | Best Case  | Average Case | Worst Case | Stable? | Space    |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------- | -------- |
|   Bubble Sort   | O(n)       | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | Yes     | O(1)     |
|   Quick Sort    | O(n log n) | O(n log n)   | O(n²)      | No      | O(log n) |

- Quick Sort is generally faster and better for large unsorted data.
- Bubble Sort is easy to implement but inefficient for large datasets
