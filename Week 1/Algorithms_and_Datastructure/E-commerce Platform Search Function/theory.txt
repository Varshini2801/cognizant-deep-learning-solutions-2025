Big O Notation:
-Big O describes the upper bound of time or space an algorithm takes as input size grows.
-It helps estimate performance, especially for large datasets.

Search Time Complexities:
Search Type	   Best Case	Average Case	Worst Case
Linear Search	    O(1)	      O(n)	       O(n)
Binary Search   	O(1)	      O(log n)	   O(log n)

-Linear Search: Scans every element
-Binary Search: Works only on sorted data and divides search space in half each time
